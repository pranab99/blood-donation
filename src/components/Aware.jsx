    <label for="q1" class="panel-title">Why should I donate blood?</label>
    <div class="panel-content">The need for blood affects us all. Eight out of ten people need blood or blood products at some time in our lives. One out of every ten patients in hospital requires blood transfusion. The number of blood donations that patients receive depends on their medical condition. Although an average of three donations is transfused to a patient, some patients require many more.

Blood is in constant demand for the treatment of patients involved in accidents, patients with anaemia, malaria, cancer or a bleeding disorder such as haemophilia. Many surgical operations would not be possible without the availability of blood. Blood may be needed during or following childbirth or for an exchange transfusion in newborn babies.

The need for blood never stops. Blood donors save lives. Every blood donation gives the person who receives it a new chance at life.</div>

    <label for="q2" class="panel-title">Who may donate blood?</label>
    <div class="panel-content">Donors should be between the ages of 18 and 65, weigh at least 50 kg and not have donated blood within the previous 12 weeks (for males). The criteria, which are applied before a person can be accepted as a blood donor, are very strict. Not everyone can be a blood donor. This is designed to protect the health of the donor as well as the health of the patient who receives the blood.

For example, people who have certain medical conditions or who are taking certain types of medication are not permitted to donate blood. People whose sexual behaviour places them at increased risk of transmitting infections through transfusion are also not permitted to donate. If any of the deferral criteria apply to you, or if for any reason you think that your blood may be unsafe to transfuse to a patient, you are advised not to donate.

The mission of the blood transfusion service is to provide all patients with sufficient, safe, quality blood and blood products. If you are in any doubt about whether you should donate blood, please discuss it with a staff member. We know it can be disappointing if you are not able to give blood. However, we hope you will understand that our overriding responsibility is to ensure the safety of donors and the safety of the blood for patients.</div>

    <label for="q3" class="panel-title">Is there anything special I need to do before donating?</label>
    <div class="panel-content">Eat at your regular mealtimes and drink plenty of fluid before you donate blood. Have a snack at least four hours before you donate, but do not eat too much right before the donation.

Before you leave the blood donor clinic after your blood donation, have some tea, coffee or a soft drink to help replace the blood volume (approximately 450 ml) which has been reduced as a result of your donation.

Avoid taking aspirin or aspirin-like anti-inflammatory medication in the 72 hours prior to your donation, because aspirin inhibits the function of blood platelets. If you have taken aspirin within this period, your blood platelet component cannot be transfused to a patient.</div>

    <label for="q4" class="panel-title">What is the procedure when I donate blood?</label>
    <div class="panel-content">Firstly, you will be asked to provide personal details such as your name, address, age, weight, ID number and/or date of birth. A medical history is taken by means of a written questionnaire.

These questions are designed to ascertain that it is medically safe for you to donate blood and that the recipient of your blood will not be harmed in any way. In addition, very personal questions relating to your mode of life and sexual behaviour are asked to ascertain that you are not at increased risk of potentially transmitting infection through transfusion. People are asked to exclude themselves from blood donation if any of the deferral criteria apply to them.

A finger prick test is performed in order to ascertain if your haemoglobin level is within a safe range for donation purposes. Potential donors will be permitted to donate only if this measurement is within the defined, acceptable range. If everything is in order you will proceed to donate your blood.</div>

    <label for="q5" class="panel-title">How often can I donate blood?</label>
    <div class="panel-content">You may donate either whole blood or a specific blood component such as blood platelets. Each type of donation requires a certain waiting period before you can give again. After a whole blood donation, a person must wait at least 56 days before donating again.

The minimum interval between whole blood donations is 12 weeks for men and 16 weeks for women. Platelet and plasma donors are able to donate more frequently.</div>

    <div class="plus">+</div>
    <label for="q6" class="panel-title">If you test the blood that is donated, why do you have such a lengthy donor selection process?</label>
    <div class="panel-content">Our duty is to provide a safe blood supply and the BTS needs your help to maintain these standards. Although all blood donations are tested for viruses, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and syphilis, there is a period of time after a person first becomes infected with a virus during which the infection may not be detectable (this is often referred to as the “window period”). So, the person's blood could still transmit a disease if transfused to a patient, even though their tests were negative and there was no sign of infection at the time of donation. Also, tests are not available for infections such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD: mad cow disease). For this reason, a thorough donor selection process is essential.</div>
